# Agricultural ML System - Complete Package

## What's Included:
✅ Backend API (Python/FastAPI) with crop recommendation endpoints
✅ Mobile App (React Native/Expo) with GPS and offline support  
✅ ML Models (XGBoost for yield prediction, Prophet for prices)
✅ Data Integration (SoilGrids, Open-Meteo, FAOSTAT, AGMARKNET)
✅ Complete deployment guides and documentation

## Quick Start:

### Backend Setup:
1. Extract this zip file
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. python fastapi_main.py
4. Visit http://localhost:8000/docs for API documentation

### Mobile App Setup:
1. Install Expo CLI: npm install -g @expo/cli
2. Create project: npx create-expo-app CropAdvisor
3. Copy App.js and components/ folder from this package
4. Copy dependencies from package.json
5. npm install
